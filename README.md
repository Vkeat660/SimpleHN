# Simple Hacker News
This used to be the Simple Hacker News app on App Store. Inspired by CS 193P on iTunes U in 2012 I build this app over a period of roughly three days so expect some “hacks”.

## Why can't I find it when I search the App Store?
It was available for no cost for about two years. Then, since I didn't work on it much I decided it's not worth it for me to keep paying $99/year to Apple.

## Why open source it?
Because the bug I was too lazy to fix has caused people to send kind emails. Some showed interest in the code base if it was open source.
